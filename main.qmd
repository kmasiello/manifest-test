Here is the document I want to deploy using git-backed deployment. I wrote the manifest with

```{r}
#| eval: false

rsconnect::writeManifest(appFiles = "main.qmd")

```

I specifically did not include "aux/aux.qmd" however when I git-back deploy from Connect, it will pull in all of the files in the repository _and attempt to run them all_. This will cause the deployment to fail because "aux.qmd" has broken code in it.
